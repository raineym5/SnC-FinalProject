# Control Systems Final Project
Good afternoon everyone,  
Here is my control systems final project.  

It uses an AtTiny13, using 1000/1024 bytes (98%) without optimizing for size. Cut it a bit close.  
The schematic is viaible in /Schem  
The ode is visible in /ATtiny13a  
The LaTeX report is visible in /Writeup  
The thermistor charactersitics recorded by hand are visible in /therm.ods  

If there are any questions, please contact me at my rowan email, I'm not going to post it here since this is public.  
Thank you and 73
